# CarpetWeave

**Address-to-Behavior Traffic Decomposition for Carpet Bombing DDoS Detection**
https://github.com/hekeming/CarpetWeave/blob/main/README.md
CarpetWeave aims to reveal the hidden behavioral structure of network traffic by decomposing observed IP-level flows into latent **behavior flows**.  
This enables accurate detection of **Carpet Bombing DDoS attacks**, where attackers distribute traffic across many IPs to evade traditional per-IP detection.

---

## âœ¨ Project Goals

- **PCAP â†’ Feature Matrix Pipeline (C++)**  
  Sliding-window or rolling-window feature extraction from raw PCAP, producing time-aligned **IP Ã— Feature** summary matrices.
- **Behavior Decomposition (Python)**  
  Explore NMF / sparse coding / tensor decomposition to recover latent behavior flows.
- **Attack Detection Application**  
  Identify abnormal behavior allocation patterns (e.g., Carpet Bombing DDoS).
